Giving people from all walks of life the ability to access the web is a noble cause. It is also a legal requirement in many countries. But what are the benefits of making your website accessible to all? Here are a few reasons why you should consider making your website accessible to all.

### Legal Compliance

Many regions have laws mandating web accessibility, making it a legal requirement for website owners. This is especially true for government websites, educational institutions, and businesses that provide services to the public. starting from June 2025, the European Accessibility Act (EAA) will be enforced within the European Union member states.

The EAA will apply to many websites some of these are

- E-commerce websites
- Websites and mobile applications that provide information for air, bus, rail, and waterborne passenger transport services
- Access to audiovisual media services

### Security

Inaccessible user interfaces can be a security issue. Think of a blind person not being able to log into a form or use an ATM without help. It would be an insecure practice to have to share your PIN or other personal details with someone else. When we make user interfaces accessible to people with disabilities, we don't force them to make a choice between access and security.

### Customer & Business Growth

The more accessible your site is, the more your web traffic could increase, the more customers you could have! The more accessible your app is, the more contracts you could win that have accessibility as a requirement (e.g. government procurement, education software, banking software, etc.).

User research with people with disabilities could highlight product opportunities and new customer segments that your organization would otherwise miss.

People with disabilities are usually associated with multiple organizations. So sites having a web accessible site that complice with WCAG guidelines could provide free marketing to these organizations.

We want that the end user is thrilled with the products and experiences we create for them on the web, and choses our creations over others.

### Improves Brand Image

Being accessible is a great way to show that your organization cares about being inclusive and that it is committed to providing equal access to all. This can improve your brand image and help you stand out from the competition. Maybe by making your site accessible you could give millions of people access to information, products, and services that they couldn't access before. Giving this way your organization a better reputation in society.

### SEO Benefits

Even though our focus needs to be on the user, it's worth noting that websites with good semantic structure are more easily crawled by search engine bots, improving SEO.

A good Heading tag structure, is crucial for navigation a site using a screen reader. ant in turn it will benefit the SEO of the site.

The alt attribute in images is very important for users using screen readers, and google did lower the importance of the alt attribute do to the abuse of it in the past. But it is still important for screen reader users.

### Professional Pride

Web developers, content creators, and designers can take pride in creating inclusive and accessible web experiences. It's a great feeling to know that you are making a difference in the world and helping people access the web.

Think of kids that would like to explorer the web, learning a new language or music instrument while using the internet. Our grand parents or your future self, they can maybe make sure the can get that medical appointment or use the web for entertainment and connect with old friends. Think also about soldiers that after a war now have a disability, or people that have been in a car accident they can be sure they are not being left out.
By you making the web accessible you are helping them, us to access the web.

### Web Performance

Faster loading pages not only make the website more "accessible" for people in remote areas but also enhance the experience for screen reader users. A slow or unresponsive website can significantly degrade the user experience for those relying on screen readers.
