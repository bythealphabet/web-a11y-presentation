It is essential for us as a team to understand our role in creating web accessible sites. In this section we will go thru the different web development components and interactions and how the work together to be accessible for people with disabilities. This way we can also help our clients make informed decisions when it comes to developing accessible websites.

### Web Accessibility Initiative WAI Guidelines

The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The WAI develops guidelines and resources to help make the web more accessible to people with disabilities. The WAI guidelines are a set of guidelines that are designed to help web developers create accessible websites. The guidelines are organized around four principles that fall under the acronym **POUR** perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. For each guideline, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA. The guidelines are not only for web content, but also for authoring tools and user agents.

**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**
Since we are a web development agency, we should focus on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The WCAG guidelines are designed to help web developers create accessible web content. The guidelines are organized around the four principles of web accessibility. The WCAG guidelines are the most widely used guidelines for web accessibility. The

other guidelines are the **Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)** these are standards for tools we use for example Figma, VSCode or Microsoft Words and the **User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)** these are standards for Web Browsers, Video Players, or Assistive Technologies.

### The Four Principles of Web Accessibility

Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable.

Understandable: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

Robust: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Content

Content creators are responsible accessible text, images, audio and video. for this the they can apply the the WCAG guidelines. We already covered some of these topics in the previous articles. but lets focus on accessible documents.

**Writing accessible text or Document Accessibility**
an accessible document is a document that is easy to read, understand and used by everyone, this includes people with disabilities, low vision Dyslexia, or other cognitive disabilities.
These documents should have a good page structure with page titles, headings, lists, and tables. The text should be written in a clear and simple language, and the document should be easy to navigate. The font should aid readability and the document should be free of spelling and grammar errors.

### Design

Dotcontrol has a very talented design team that is responsible for creating well designed web pages, that have good color contrast good white space, and a good visual hierarchy.

### Assistive Technologies

We should have an understanding of what kind of assistive technologies are available and how they work. This way we can make sure that our websites are compatible with these technologies. and we can use them for testing our websites, specially screen readers.

### The Developer

having a good understanding of html semantics is crucial for creating accessible websites. the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) the language of the web. is already accessible by default, developers need to know what HTML elements are available and how to use them correctly. The same goes for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.

### Evaluation and Testing Tools

There are many tools available to help us evaluate and test our websites for accessibility. These tools can help us identify accessibility issues and provide suggestions on how to fix them. Some of these tools are free and some are paid. Some of these tools are browser extensions, and some are standalone applications.

### Users

Users can contribute by providing feedback on the accessibility for our websites. there for we can provide a way for user to report accessibility issues.

### The Implementation Cycle

When accessibility features are well implemented in one component, the other components are more likely to implement them as well. Think a well designed website created by a Dotcontrol designer, this will make it easier for the developer to do its part and translated the design to code. which in turn makes it easier for the content creator to focus on the message it wants to convey and, in turn the assistive technology will be able to perform well and so the end user will benefit from the information its receiving and it can provide feedback and so the cycle continues.

but if one of the components is weak than the whole implementation falls apart. for example if the user can not even start navigating the site. it will not be able to give any feedback. or the feedback well come in the form of a penalty from the government, which we for sure do not want.
